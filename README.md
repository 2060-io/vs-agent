# 2060-service-agent

2060 Agent running in a container, used as gateway for any service to access 2060 ecosystem.

## Configuration

At the moment, all configuration is done by environment variables. All of them are optional for development
but likely needed for production and test deployments.

> **Note**: While not mandatory, it is recommended to set an agent public DID matching external hostname (e.g. if your Service Agent instance is accessable in `https://myagent.com:3000` you must set AGENT_PUBLIC_DID to `did:web:myagent.com%3A3000`), which will make possible for the agent to create its own creadential types and therefore issue credentials. Note that you'll need HTTPS in order to fully support did:web specification.
>
> Public DID will be used also for agents to easily connect to it using DIDComm without the need of creating an explicit invitation by doing a GET request to `/invitation` endpoint.
>
> The Service Agent fetches capabilities from the `discovery.json` file at `/www/packages/main/discovery.json` to determine available features. To customize the capabilities, replace the volume at this path with your own `discovery.json` file. This allows flexibility for defining different capabilities.
>
> If the `POSTGRES_HOST` environment variable is defined, the Service Agent will handle the connection to operate with the specified database. Please note that this type of persistence is recommended because by default, an SQLite database is used for testing purposes. Due to SQLite's lack of robustness, it does not support a high throughput of messages per second. Therefore, for any production deployment, it is recommended to use a more robust PostgreSQL database, which allows processing large volumes of data efficiently and properly managing existing data and security credentials.  
>
> If the `REDIS_HOST` environment variable is defined, the Service Agent can leverage Redis as a caching system to achieve high-performance message processing. By offloading message handling and enabling asynchronous processing, Redis helps optimize I/O operations and significantly enhances the serviceâ€™s capacity to manage large volumes of data efficiently.

Possible log levels:

- 0: test
- 1: trace
- 2: debug
- 3: info
- 4: warn
- 5: error
- 6: fatal
- 7: off

These variables might be set also in `.env` file in the form of KEY=VALUE (one per line).

## Deploy and run

2060-service-agent can be run both locally or containerized.

### Locally

2060-service-agent can be built and run on localhost by just setting the corresponding variables and executing:

```
pnpm build
pnpm dev
```

Upon a successful start, the following lines should be read in log:

```
Service Agent running in port xxxx. Admin interface at port yyyy
```

This means that Service Agent is up and running!

### Using docker

First of all, a docker image must be created by doing:

```
docker build -t 2060-service-agent:[tag] .
```

Then, a container can be created and deployed:

```
docker run -e AGENT_PUBLIC_DID=... -e AGENT_ENDPOINT=... -e AGENT_PORT=yyy -e USE_CORS=xxx -p yyy:xxx 2060-service-agent:[tag]
```

where yyy is an publicly accesible port from the host machine.

## API

For the moment, some details about Service Agent API can be found in this [Document](./doc/service-agent-api.md). There is some work in progress to make the API available within Swagger: when deployed, just go to [SERVICE_AGENT_ADMIN_BASE_URL]/api.
